# Install

Copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env`.

Set the `APP_PORT` variable to whatever port you want to access the app.

Then, run: `make install`.
This will prepare the app to listen.

# Run

Located in the project root, run: `make run` or `make run-dev` if you want it in development mode.
